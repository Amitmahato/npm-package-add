# Question to Answer & Problems To Solve

- Have you ever faced an error like:

  ```
  import lodash from "lodash";
  ^^^^^^

  SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
  ```

  OR

  ```
  const lodash = require("lodash");
           ^

  ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
  ```

- Have you ever got confused whether you should use `require` or `import` to use codes from some other files or from packages installed into `node_modules` directory?
- Have you ever wondered what the heck is **CommonJS** and **ES module**?
- Have you ever build your own npm packages?
